   The selected device is shown when the list is closed and is identified by having a checkmark to the left of its name on the list.

   The selected device will be remembered on launch and the app will send silence right away the moment it is connected. It will always send silence on launch if the last selected device is available. If it is not, it will not send silence until another device is selected and Start is clicked or the last selected device is connected again.
   Note that when the logo is filled in, the app is sending silence and when it is empty, it is not. 

7. To launch at login, add this app to Login Items under Settings > General > Login Items & Extensions > Open at Login. As stated, when the last selected device is connected, it will send silence right away.

3. Open KeepMacAudioAlive.xcodeproj on Xcode.

6. Follow 4. through 6. for the download version.

## Credits
This app and even its icon were originally made using Gemini 3 Pro, so all credits to them for that, and use it at your own risk. The menubar UI was made by me based on code from LosslessSwitcher 2.0 beta2.
